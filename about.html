        <h4>
            Hi there, my name is Tarush Sinha!
        </h4>

        <p>
            I have a strong international background, am trilingual in English, Hindi, and Mandarin, and have a 
            proven ability to work in a multicultural environment demonstrated by my work in the United States, 
            Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park. My degree focus was 
            in Computer & Network Security, Cryptography & Computer Architecture, and I have an upper-level 
            concentration in Leadership Studies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having worked in the industry for a few years, I've worn many hats. I've worked as an engineer 
            across the stack, worked as a technology consultant, and have experience in Sales, Marketing & BizOps.
            This flexibility has enabled me to work in and gain exposure in industries including Aviation, Security, 
            Social Media, and the Gaming Industry to name a few.
        </p>

        <p>
            My most recent role was working at TikTok U.S. Data Security as an R&D Engineer on the Data Platform team.
            During my time there, I led the Data Ingestion team and collaborated intensively with cross-region teams in 
            the U.S., Singapore, and China. While I explore new opportunities, I am serving as an technology consultant 
            to Citadel Health as they look to build technology into their hospital ecosystem from the ground up.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've been labelled a Renaissance Man on more occassion than one, with interests ranging from technology to 
            music and dance. When I'm not working, you can find me reading a new book, cooking, or travelling and exploring 
            new cities, cultures, and the local history.
