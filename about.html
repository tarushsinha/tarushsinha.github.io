    <h4>
        Hi there, my name is Tarush Sinha!
    </h4>
    <p>
        I have a strong international background, am trilingual in English, Hindi, and Mandarin, and have a proven ability to work in a multicultural environment demonstrated by my work in the United States, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

        <br>
        <br>

        I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, College Park. 
        My degree focus was in Computer & Network Security, Cryptography & Computer Architecture, and I have an upper-level concentration in Leadership Studies.

        Having worked in the industry for a few years, I've worn many hats. 
        I've worked as an engineer across the stack, worked as a technology consultant, and have experience in Sales, Marketing & BizOps.
        This flexibility has enabled me to work in and gain exposure in industries including Aviation, Security, Social Media, and the Gaming Industry to name a few.

        My most recent role was working at TikTok U.S. Data Security as an R&D Engineer on the Data Platform team.
        During my time there, I led the Data Ingestion team and collaborated intensively with cross-region teams in the U.S., Singapore, and China.
        While I explore new opportunities, I am serving as an technology consultant to Citadel Health as they look to build technology into their hospital ecosystem from the ground up.

        I've been labelled a Renaissance Man on more occassion than one, with interests ranging from technology to music and dance.
        When I'm not working, you can find me reading a new book, cooking, or travelling and exploring new cities, cultures, and the local history.
